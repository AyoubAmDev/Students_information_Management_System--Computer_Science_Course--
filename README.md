This is a comprehensive program designed to facilitate the management of student information for the G.I class at EST Agadir. Powered by linked lists, this program offers a wide range of features to efficiently organize and handle student data.

With this system, you can effortlessly perform various tasks such as displaying the complete list of students with their first and last names, sorting the list in ascending or descending order based on student averages, retrieving detailed information about specific students, adding new students to the list, and removing them as needed.

Furthermore, the system provides advanced search capabilities, allowing you to find students who share the same first name, age, or average. You can also calculate the average of all student averages and identify students with averages equal to or greater than the average of averages. Additionally, the system enables you to quickly locate the student with the highest average, known as the majorant, as well as the student with the lowest average.

Simplicity and convenience are at the core of this project, empowering you to efficiently manage the class information and keep it well-organized. Whether you are a teacher, administrator, or student, our project offers a powerful tool to streamline the student information management process.
